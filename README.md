# Generate-abstract-art-StyleGAN

HP Mosaic algorithm let you create automatic designs based on core patterns. It automatically generates a potentially unlimited number of unique graphic designs based on a fixed number of base patterns (also called seeds). Those seeds are the heart of the process. HP Mosaic technology uses an algorithm to create designs from those patterns.

The purpose of this project is to help designers create those Mosaic seeds, which are unique and complex base patterns designs fitted to HP Mosaic requirements. The goal is to use machine learning to generate base patterns to feed the Mosaic algorithm with. The generated base patterns should be complex vector patterns in SVG or PDF format, based on a dataset of other seeds and user input.
